# My Portfolio Website  

This project is a **portfolio website** designed to showcase my work as a **software developer**. It includes an interactive **project gallery** and a **contact form** that allows visitors to reach out directly.  

## Overview  
- The website highlights my **projects** and provides **detailed descriptions** in a **modal window** for each one.  
- Visitors can use the **contact form**, which securely sends their messages to my email using **FormSubmit**.  

## Project Structure  

- **`formsubmit.js`** – Handles form validation, submission via FormSubmit, and UI feedback.  
- **`index.js`** – Manages project modal functionality and interactive features.  
- **`index.html`** – Contains the main structure of the website, including the contact form and project modals.  
- **`styles.css`** – Defines the website’s styling, ensuring a **professional yet colorful** look.  

## FormSubmit Integration  
This site uses **FormSubmit** to handle contact form submissions. When users fill in the form and click **"Submit,"** their details are securely emailed to me. This ensures that messages are delivered directly to my inbox for review.  

### The form collects the following data:  
✅ **First Name**  
✅ **Surname**  
✅ **Email**  
✅ **Message**  

## Key Features  

### Project Modals  
- Each project in the portfolio has a **clickable area** that opens a **modal** with more details.  
- This keeps the portfolio **clean and organized** while still allowing users to read more about each project.  

### Contact Form  
The contact form includes **basic client-side validation**. Once all required fields are filled, the form triggers the following:  

  ✅ **Data Validation** – Ensures all fields are completed and checks for a valid email format.  
  ✅ **Form Submission** – Sends the data securely via **FormSubmit**, which delivers the message directly to my inbox.  
  ✅ **UI Feedback** – Displays a confirmation message, resets the form fields, and disables the **Submit** button to prevent duplicate submissions.  

## What I Learned  
This project deepened my understanding of **client-side JavaScript** and **form handling**. Key areas I explored include:  

🔹 Integrating **FormSubmit** for handling contact form submissions.  
🔹 Implementing **form validation** and **UI feedback**.  
🔹 Ensuring **accessibility and usability** for a seamless user experience.  

## Future Improvements  
While the project currently meets my needs, I plan to add:  
🚀 **Error Handling** – More detailed error messages for failed submissions.  
🎨 **Animations & UI Enhancements** – Adding subtle animations to improve user experience.  
🔐 **Backend Integration** – Exploring server-side handling for additional security.  

## Conclusion  
This **portfolio website** is an evolving showcase of my work as a developer. The **FormSubmit integration** provides a **simple and efficient** way to manage contact requests, ensuring I stay connected with those interested in my work.
